## Web Developer

This is my personal website to showcase my skills and knowledge that I have learned so far and
a place for people to view my completed projects and be able to contact me

## Site Goals

* The goals of this site is to give prospective clients and employers a visual look at my work
* For them to be able to assess the code and functionality of the site
* To be able to see my previously completed projects
* To provide them with ways to contact me

## User Stories 

* As a potential client I want to be able to see the previous work done 
* As a potential client I want to be able to contact the developer easily
* As a site user I would like a clear navigation menu
* As a mobile user I want a website that is designed for mobile devices
* As a site user I would like to leave comments feedback for the web developer

## UX Design

The overall look for the website is minimalist with dark backgrounds and the images have a dark overlay.
This dark background is contrasted with splashes of bright colour to add life to the site. Buttons are bright 
and react to the users action
